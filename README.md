# Basic Exercise
You just need to create a data folder in the same directory of the project.
Then add your own pictures inside this one.
Then in the code (line-58), locate the line of the loading of the image and rename it with the name of your own image that you have previously add in the data folder.
In the example: Test = loadImage ("1.png");
So just put 1.png.
